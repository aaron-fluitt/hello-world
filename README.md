# hello-world
this is my first github repository.

Hi Students! 

I'm Aaron Fluitt, and I will be one of your TAs this semester. 
I graduated from Georgetown Law in 2017, and I've been working 
as a fellow at the Institute for Tech Law & Policy ever since. 
I work with computer scientists from main campus on privacy-preserving 
technology and related privacy law & regulatory regimes.
